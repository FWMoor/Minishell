## Disclaimer:  
This project isn't perfect! Use my code at your own risk. I know of some flags and args not working, if you would like to chat about it, come to my table or send me a slack. This was done with A LOT help from [Mike](https://github.com/MikeFMeyer), [Zia](https://github.com/ziadhorat) and [Nolin](https://github.com/nreddystudent).
